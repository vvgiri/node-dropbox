## Implemented CRUD server

Create/Update a new file/folder  using PUT
```shellscript
curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo" -X PUT
curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo2/bar2" -X PUT

#create a file with content "some-content"
curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo/bar.js" -d "some-content" -X PUT 

#update a file with content "new content"
curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo/bar.js" -d "new content -X PUT
```

GET info from file/folder
```shellscript
 curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" -X GET
 curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo/bar.js" -X GET
 curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo/bar.js" --head
```

DELETE file/folder(recursively)
```shellscript
curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo/bar.js" -X DELETE

## Implemented client-server tcp connection

There is another TCP server using nssocket that starts with the CRUD server.  The purpose of the TCP server is to sync up with the client server.

1. Every CRUD action on the CRUD server emit a event(create/update or delete)
2. that event get listened by the TCP server
3. When the TCP server catch the event, it pushes the event to the TCP client.(client.js)
4. When TCP client receives the event, it executes file system operations for CRUD on it's local copy of system
5. In my demo. the remote server uses /tmp/server folder. the tcp client uses /tmp/client folder.
